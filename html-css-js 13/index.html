        <p>Excellence is an art won by training and habituation.
          We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence,
          but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do.
          Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.</p>
          <p>Must we not, ask ourselves what that is which, as we imagine, is liable to
            be scattered, and about which we fear? and what again is that about which we have no
            fear? And then we may proceed further to enquire whether that which suffers dispersion
            is or is not of the nature of soulâ€”our hopes and fears as to our own souls will turn upon
            the answers to these questions. </p>
            <p>The Republic is full of hope and aspiration: the Laws bear the stamp of failure and
              disappointment. The one is a finished work which received the last touches of the
              author: the other is imperfectly executed, and apparently unfinished. The one has the
              grace and beauty of youth: the other has lost the poetical form, but has more of the
              severity and knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age. </p>
              <p>Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds,
                so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.</p>
                <p>Then now let me ask the awful question, which is this: "Can a man know
                  and also not know that which he knows?"</p>
